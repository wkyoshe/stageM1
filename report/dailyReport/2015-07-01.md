##TASKS:   
###FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS OF  THE "PREREQUISITES DOCUMENTATION ON FEELPP-BOOK":   
 - The aim is to finally have a very portable and reliable documentation of the feel++ tools. Thus, i make necessary improvements all the time.

###FEELPP PROJECT   
 I am still working on the CMakeLists.txt of the feelpp project to enable doxygen to generate a documenation via ```make doc```
 
 ```c++
 INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} )
if(FEELPP_ENABLE_DOXYGEN)
find_package(Doxygen)
  if(NOT DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR
      "Doxygen is needed to build the documentation. Please install it correctly")
  endif()
configure_file(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in 
                       ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/doxygen/Doxyfile @ONLY)
configure_file(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/footer.html ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/doxygen/footer.html @ONLY)
configure_file(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/header.html ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/doxygen/header.html @ONLY)
configure_file(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/layout.xml ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/doxygen/layout.xml @ONLY)
configure_file(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/feel.css ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/doxygen/feel.css @ONLY)
  
   
add_custom_command(	
                  OUTPUT ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/html/index.html
                         ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/latex/Makefile 
                         ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/latex/refman.tex)           
add_custom_target (doc ALL
            COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile
            SOURCES ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/doxygen/Doxygen.in
            COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen" VERBATIM))  

  add_custom_target(html
           DEPENDS ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc/html/index.html
                    ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/latex/Makefile)
endif()
 ```
 We want to finally be able to generate the documentation of feelpp project using doxygen via ```cmake doc```.
