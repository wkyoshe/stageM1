##TASKS :   
  - Improve Dummy project 
  - Read and eventually simplify Feel++ book prerequisites

##RESULTS :
  - Dummy project works well ! 
  - When I started to read the Feel++ book I felt the need to 
    know how to create a CMakeList.txt and master the basics.
    To serve this purpose I followed some tutorials and tested 
    codes that I wrote.
  - I read the tutorial on  [Makefile Tuto](http://gl.developpez.com/tutoriel/outil/makefile/)
    and quickly the basics for creating an efficient Makefile. 
  - I have not seen currently something to change in the prerequisites
    but I think that what I have learned today will help me to find tomorrow some improvements
    for prerequisites
