##TASKS :   
 - Checking & reproducing the Step by Step tutorial 
  - The aim here is to read and understand the step by step tutorial and finally to be able to reproduce the tutorial, by making all necessary modifications and comments.
  - We also ommit all unnecessary info from the tutorial.   
 - Setting and compiling feelpp source codes to generate the necessary :   
   - log files
   - confi files
   - Expected Results (mesh)   

 To compile our codes, we simply use the command line  `make  feelpp_doc_<appname>`.   
  For instance, `make feelpp_doc_myapp` for myapp.   
  
  We can also use  parallelism to compile our source code, for example `make -j 10 feelpp_doc_<appname>`   
  
  ***NOTE*** : We have to build a temporary build directory where we can compile our codes:   
  
   - To visualize the generated mesh, we can use the following line command :   
     `ssh -Y … […] gmsh theFile.{msh,geo}`
