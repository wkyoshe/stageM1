###FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS OF  THE "PREREQUISITES DOCUMENTATION ON FEELPP-BOOK":   
 - The aim is to finally have a very portable and reliable documentation of the feel++ tools. Thus, i make necessary improvements all the time.

###FEELPP PROJECT   
 - The goal here is to create a CMakLists.txt to enable Doxygen to generate a documentation with the line command ```make doc```.   
 Of course we will have to activate the process by setting ```FEELPP_ENABLE_DOXYGEN = ON```   
Here is the proposed code to be added in the doxygen file:   
```c++
INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} )
if(FEELPP_ENABLE_DOXYGEN)
find_package(Doxygen)
  if(NOT DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR
      "Doxygen is needed to build the documentation. Please install it correctly")
  endif()
  configure_file(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Doxyfile.in 
                       ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile @ONLY)
  add_custom_target(doc ALL
             COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile
                  COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen" VERBATIM)
endif()
```
Then we add the subdirectory doxygen to doc/CMakeLists.txt.
