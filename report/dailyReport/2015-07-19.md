##TASKS :   
 - Checking & reproducing the Step by Step tutorial 
  - The aim here is to read and understand the step by step tutorial and finally to be able to reproduce the tutorial, by making all necessary modifications and comments.

  
 - CMakeLists.txt to compile the feelpp-book source codes  
   - The aim here is to create a CMakeList.txt to compile the examples(codes) given in the feelpp-book.   
   Below is the proposed CMakeLists.txt :
   
 ```sh
