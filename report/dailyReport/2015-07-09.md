##TASKS :  
- Making necessary improvements in various files of feelpp project to finally have the desired documentation
 - Editing the Doxyfile.in to include necessary paths for the missing logos, version number etc.
 - Editing the doc/api/CMakeLists.txt to enable us to use `make doxygen`
 - Omiting some un necessary info from the CMakeLists.txt and  from various other files
 - Editing MainPage.md   
 
 
##RESULTS :   
- Now we can generate a desired documentation. I have included a simple script to help simplify the whole process.
```c++
!/bin/bash                                                                                         

rm -r build
mkdir buld
cd build
cmake ..
make doxygen
cd build/doc/api/html
firefox index.hml
```   

This is how our MainPage looks like now.
